Automated Waste Sorting with Deep Learning and Data Analysis
Tackling Waste with Vision and Insight
This project develops an automated waste sorting system using deep learning to classify different types of waste from images, combined with robust data analysis to understand sorting efficiency and identify areas for improvement. By leveraging computer vision, we aim to enhance the notoriously inefficient manual waste sorting process, contributing to a more sustainable future.

Comprehensive Data Analysis: Explores, visualizes, and analyzes waste datasets to uncover patterns, identify misclassification tendencies, and provide actionable insights into sorting performance.
Model Training & Evaluation: Implements efficient training routines with hyperparameter tuning and rigorous evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, alongside visual tools like confusion matrices.
Modular Codebase: Organizes the project into logical, reusable Python scripts, promoting good software engineering practices.
Interactive Prediction Demo (Optional): A simple web interface to demonstrate real-time classification of uploaded images.
Technical Stack
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow 2.x / Keras
Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV, Pillow (PIL)
Data Science Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Deployment (Optional): Flask (for the web demo)
Version Control: Git / GitHub
Dataset
This project primarily utilizes the TrashNet dataset (or similar publicly available waste image datasets like custom collected images for specific waste types if you choose).

Source: [Link to Dataset - e.g., Kaggle, original source]
Description: The dataset typically consists of images categorized into various waste types, providing a foundation for training a robust classification model. (Specify approximate number of images and classes if known, e.g., "It comprises X images across Y classes such as 'plastic', 'paper', 'cardboard', 'glass', 'metal', and 'trash'.").

Results & Analysis
Our model achieved an overall accuracy of XX% on the test set. Here are some key findings:

Confusion Matrix: (Include a link to an image of your confusion matrix or embed it directly if your README supports it). This visualization highlights that categories like 'plastic' and 'cardboard' were often accurately classified, while 'trash' (mixed waste) presented a greater challenge, sometimes being confused with 'metal' due to visual similarities.
Per-Class Metrics:
Plastic: Precision: X%, Recall: Y%, F1-Score: Z%
Paper: Precision: X%, Recall: Y%, F1-Score: Z%
(List all classes)
Learning Curves: (Include a link to images of your training/validation accuracy and loss curves). These graphs show that the model converged well, with reasonable gaps between training and validation performance, indicating limited overfitting.
Insights from Data Analysis:
The dataset exhibited a slight imbalance, with 'plastic' and 'paper' images being more abundant than 'trash' or 'glass'. This imbalance likely contributed to varied per-class performance.
Misclassification analysis revealed that images with poor lighting, unusual angles, or partial occlusion were particularly challenging for the model, suggesting areas for further data augmentation or specialized preprocessing.
Future Work
This project lays a strong foundation, and there are several exciting avenues for future enhancements:

Expanded Dataset: Incorporate a larger and more diverse dataset, including images from varied real-world scenarios (different lighting, backgrounds, degrees of damage/dirt).
Advanced Architectures: Experiment with more complex or specialized CNN architectures (e.g., EfficientNet, Vision Transformers) to potentially improve classification accuracy.
Object Detection: Migrate from image classification to object detection to not just classify waste but also locate individual waste items within an image, which is crucial for robotic sorting.
Real-time Processing: Optimize the model for faster inference to enable real-time waste sorting applications.
Edge Deployment: Explore deploying the model on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson) for decentralized sorting solutions.
Active Learning: Implement an active learning strategy to intelligently select new data for labeling, focusing on examples where the model is uncertain, to improve efficiency of data annotation.
